All the changes in the code made by Stanislav Sokolov are marked with
"//SSS" comment.

Common Files:
	Macros 'min' and 'max' defined in common/mathlib.h conflict with
	C++ definitions used by NETVIS. Changed names to 'Min' and 'Max'
	and changed invocations throughout the tools.

	Reintroduced onfig.h.in for use with the added configure
	script. Solves the problem of STDC_HEADERS not being included.
	The compile procedure is:
	 ./configure
	 make

	Irritating warning of "No newline at the end of file" is fixed for
	most of the files.

CSG:
	Added wadpath.cpp, wadcfg.cpp and autowad.cpp to the compile set
	in make.inc

BSP:
	No changes

VIS:
	No essencial changes (except for Min and Max in flow.cpp and an
	#ifndef to resovle a Netvis issue)


RAD:
	No changes (except for Min and Max in lightmap.cpp)


NETVIS:
	Class names and constants from CommonC++ are not in the correct
	scope. Added 'ost::' to
	in ZHLTThread.h:
	 Thread and Event
	in NetvisSession.h:
	 TCPSocket, InetHostAddress, tpport_t, TCPStream, Mutex  
	in SocketThreads.cpp:
	 InetHostAddress, Socket
	in NetvisSession.cpp:
	 InetHostAddress, tpport_t, SOCKET_PENDING_ERROR,
	 SOCKET_PENDING_INPUT, TCPSocket, Socket, SOCKET_BINDING_FAILED
	in packet.cpp:
	 Mutex, 

	SOCKET_COMPLETION_IMMEDIATE was not defined any place, made ad
	conditional define in NetvisSession.h

	in make.inc changed library -lccxx to -lccgnu and added -ldl
	(using CommonC++ 1.9.7)	

	in make.inc added common/winding.cpp to the comple set

	GetVisBlock(char*) is undefined from flow.cpp as vis.cpp is not
	used in NETVIS. Worked around by adding '#ifndef ZHLT_NETVIS'
	around BlockVis() in flow.cpp

RIPENT:
	Fixed malformed make.inc (for some reason only UNIX-style
	newlines work here).

	GetParamsFromEnt breaks RIPENT copilation as bspfile.cpp, which is
	required by RIPENT make an unresolved reference to
	GetParamsFromEnt. Solved by adding an IN_RIPENT define in
	ripent/make.inc and adding two #ifndef IN_RIPENT in bspfile.cpp to
	exclude GetParamsFromEnt. Can probably be done more elegantly...
